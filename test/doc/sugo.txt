Pseudocode
----------

test names are given on the command line for now.
Each argument is the name of one test.
Each test is an executable.
The result of running the test is either 0, non zero, or an abort.
If 0 is success
If non-0 is failure
If abort, is fatal error!
Print output in Asciidoc for now so it can be rendered in HTML
